Plant disease identification and categorization are critical for guaranteeing sustainable and efficient agricultural practises. Farmers can apply effective steps to prevent disease transmission and crop losses if infected plants are identified in a timely manner. The use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) has shown considerable potential in automating the picture categorization process for plant health monitoring as machine learning and computer vision have advanced. We may construct intelligent systems that can quickly and reliably discern between healthy and unhealthy plants based on their visual properties by utilising the capabilities of GANs. This work seeks to investigate the use of GANs in smart agriculture for image classification, offering a promising method to improve crop management and maximise agricultural productivity.
